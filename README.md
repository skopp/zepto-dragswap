HTML5 Sortable jQuery Plugin
============================

**[Demos](http://james2doyle.github.com/zepto-dragswap)**

Why Not Sortable
----------------
It is sortable, but its more like swappable...

Features
--------

* 2KB (minified).
* Built using native HTML5 drag and drop API.
* Supports both list and grid style layouts.
* Add drop animations with CSS3.
* Class control for move, over, drop and exclude.
* Vender prefix getter for detecting animation end.
* Works in IE 7+, Firefox 16+, Chrome 23+, Safari 5.1+ and, Opera 12.1+.

Usage
-----
Use `sortable` method to create a sortable list:

``` javascript
$('.sortable').dragswap({
    element: 'li', // the child element you are targeting
    overClass: 'over', // class when element goes over another element
    moveClass: 'moving', // class when element is moving
    dropClass: 'drop', // the class to add when the element is dropped
    dropAnimation: false, // do you want to detect animation end?
    exclude: '.disabled', // excluded elements class
    prefix: getPrefix(), // function to get the prefix of the browser
    dropComplete: function(){} // what to do when the drop is complete
});
```

``` javascript
$('.sortable').dragswap('toArray');
// returns the id of each element in the current order
```

Drop Animation
--------------
There is a function to detect animation end in the drop handler. Enabling dropAnimation will detect this. Otherwise the class will stay on the elements.

To Do
-----

* control the attributes to be swapped
* serialize/toJSON export
* elements actually sort and don't just swap
* test in <IE9 because classList should be used
* connected lists
* drag handle
